# Welcome to Levantr

For this assessment, we will be looking for a sample of what you can do while working for us! This test is to measure your style of coding, how you approach problems, project organization, and overall experience. 

Feel free to use code comments to explain your decisions!

Where to start?

### `git clone https://github.com/Levantr/sample-coding-test.git` to clone the project to your local computer.

### `yarn install` to install the project.

### This project is using SCSS / Antd / React / Redux to make things easier. 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### Below is an image of your assignment (Our actual application):

For this test, you'll be asked to create a VERY simple version of this page. 

1) Create a plus button that adds cards to the page. The plus button should be the same size as the cards (as shown in the screenshot).
2) A VERY simple form that adds card; Each card can be pre-populated with the fake sample image called "sample-card-image" in the project images folder. 
3) The form should take ONLY title and description and add them to the card. Don't worry about the other fields (price, duration, etc).
4) Use the pre-setup redux store, check to make sure this is responsive, and project organization will be looked at. 
5) Do not worry about the header, footer, or navigation bars; only design the plus button card and the idea cards.   
6) Idea cards should populate according to how they are added, newest added comes first. 
7) Mobile responsiveness will be checked. It should default to one card at a time. 

Please ask if there are any questions!

Bonus Points: 
1) Add a top bar that sorts by A-Z title and New-Old. 
2) Any addition organization strategies or tips!
